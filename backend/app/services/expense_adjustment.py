Expense Adjustment Service

Handles expense rollbacks, corrections, and reversals.
Maintains accounting integrity by creating compensatory balance entries.

IMPORTANT: When adjusting paid expenses:
1. Refund to original account (positive balance entry)
2. If account changes, deduct from new account (negative balance entry)
3. Update expense payment state
4. Record adjustment for audit trail
